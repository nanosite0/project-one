    <h1>My Top 10 Favorite Movies</h1>
    <h2>My personal ranking of favorite films, ascending.</h2>
    <h3>10.) Dragon Ball Super: Broly</h3>
    <p>The animation is incredible, the fight choreography is exciting, and has great fanservice. While this movie isn't for everyone, this is the peak of Dragon Ball content. I'm a newer Dragon Ball fan and this movie easily shot up to my favorites.</p>
    <h3>9.) Avengers: Infinity War</h3>
    <p>I still remember the excitement surrounding the movie when I was a kid. The story is well-paced and builds Thanos's character phenomenally. Although I placed Endgame higher, I personally think this was the better written one.</p>
    <h3>8.) The Batman</h3>
    <p>This take on Batman was very inspiring to me. I loved how the setting and world building was designed. For me, this is the most interesting rendition of Batman's character except for maybe the animated series.</p>
    <h3>7.) Avengers: Endgame</h3>
    <p>This movie is still incredibly exciting and the best send off to the MCU's legacy at that point. Many characters got closure that was satisfying to see. But it has to be the final battle that solidified it being better than Infinity War, at least for me.</p>
    <h3>6.) The Super Mario Bros. Movie</h3>
    <p>I grew up playing Super Mario, which were always my favorites. Since video games are my favorite form of media, and Mario is so close to my life, the movie practically being a big love letter to franchise made up for it's otherwise weak story. I don't think this movie is objectively the best, but I simply like it more.</p>
    <h3>5.) Puss in Boots: The Last Wish</h3>
    <p>This movie is just too good. The animation is stellar, as well as the art style. The story is very meaningful and executed it's intention flawlessly.</p>
    <h3>4.) Shrek 2</h3>
    <p>One of the funniest movies I've seen. I love every scene and what they're going for. It's engaging, comedically clever, and full of heart.</p>
    <h3>3.) The Dark Knight</h3>
    <p>One of the most thrilling movies out there. It's an expertly crafted film, with a clear vision evident with every scene. It's tightly paced; every scene has meaning. The action combined with the tension just further elevates the movie for me. A must-watch.</p>
    <h3>2.) Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</h3>
    <p>A worthy follow-up to the first Spider-Verse film. I've been anticipating the film for a while towards it's release, and it lived up and then some. This and the fist film are neck-and-neck in terms of quality, but I only gave the edge to the first because it closed of it's story without a cliffhanger.</p>
    <h3>1.) Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</h3>
    <p>A serious contender for one of the best movies ever made, and definitely the best comic book movie. Everything is perfect from animation, characterizations, music, pacing, plot, and respect to the franchise. I don't think I will ever see a better movie, unless the third film can manage to top it.</p>
